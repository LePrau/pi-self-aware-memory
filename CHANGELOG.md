# Changelog

## 0.0.1 — 2026-09-25 (scaffold)

- Initial scaffold as a pi package: `package.json` with the `pi` manifest,
  `extensions/self-aware-memory/index.ts` entry, `src/` (identity, state, output),
  zero runtime dependencies.
- `/sam` status surface and one-line announce at session start; `mode` subcommand
  (in-memory, session-local); `fold`/`report`/`undo` registered as honest "not yet" stubs.
- No session mutation in any code path: no tools, no entries, no context edits, no
  messages; fail-open status handlers.
- `node --test` suite (state, output, factory wiring against a fake ExtensionAPI).
- Typecheck harness (`typecheck/run-typecheck.sh`) with version floor, `PI_EXPECT` pin
  and `CONTROL=1` seeded-error discipline.
